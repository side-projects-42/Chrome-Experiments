         * specification. To run this file on an ES5 or almost ES5
         * implementation where the {@code WeakMap} specification does not
         * quite conform, run <code>repairES5.js</code> first.
         *
         * <p>Even though WeakMapModule is not global, the linter thinks it
         * is, which is why it is in the overrides list below.
         *
         * <p>NOTE: Before using this WeakMap emulation in a non-SES
         * environment, see the note below about hiddenRecord.

        /**
         * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the
         * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.
         *
         * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not
         * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not
         * retain the keys it indexes. A map by itself also does not retain
         * the values associated with that map.
         *
         * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are
         * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are
         * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all
         * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime
         * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even
         * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been
         * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as
         * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant
         * to ongoing computation.
         *
         * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented
         * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,
         * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):
         * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API
         * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.
         *
         * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in
         * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,
         * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent
         * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive
         * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods
         * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,
         * an object of {@code [[Class]]} "WeakMap}), since there is nothing
         * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,
         * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being
         * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same
         * names.
         *
         * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code
         * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the
         * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap
         * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications
         * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this
         * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to
         * prevent access to this channel. (See
         * PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in repairES5.js).

           * Security depends on HIDDEN_NAME being both <i>unguessable</i> and
           * <i>undiscoverable</i> by untrusted code.
           *
           * <p>Given the known weaknesses of Math.random() on existing
           * browsers, it does not generate unguessability we can be confident
           * of.
           *
           * <p>It is the monkey patching logic in this file that is intended
           * to ensure undiscoverability. The basic idea is that there are
           * three fundamental means of discovering properties of an object:
           * The for/in loop, Object.keys(), and Object.getOwnPropertyNames(),
           * as well as some proposed ES6 extensions that appear on our
           * whitelist. The first two only discover enumerable properties, and
           * we only use HIDDEN_NAME to name a non-enumerable property, so the
           * only remaining threat should be getOwnPropertyNames and some
           * proposed ES6 extensions that appear on our whitelist. We monkey
           * patch them to remove HIDDEN_NAME from the list of properties they
           * returns.
           *
           * <p>TODO(erights): On a platform with built-in Proxies, proxies
           * could be used to trap and thereby discover the HIDDEN_NAME, so we
           * need to monkey patch Proxy.create, Proxy.createFunction, etc, in
           * order to wrap the provided handler with the real handler which
           * filters out all traps using HIDDEN_NAME.
           *
           * <p>TODO(erights): Revisit Mike Stay's suggestion that we use an
           * encapsulated function at a not-necessarily-secret name, which
           * uses the Stiegler shared-state rights amplification pattern to
           * reveal the associated value only to the WeakMap in which this key
           * is associated with that value. Since only the key retains the
           * function, the function can also remember the key without causing
           * leakage of the key, so this doesn't violate our general gc
           * goals. In addition, because the name need not be a guarded
           * secret, we could efficiently handle cross-frame frozen keys.

           *     obtains access to the value associated with that key in that
           *     weak map.

           * We do so by
           * <ul>
           * <li>Making the name of the hidden property unguessable, so "[]"
           *     indexing, which we cannot intercept, cannot be used to access
           *     a property without knowing the name.
           * <li>Making the hidden property non-enumerable, so we need not
           *     worry about for-in loops or {@code Object.keys},
           * <li>monkey patching those reflective methods that would
